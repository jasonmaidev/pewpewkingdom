		Players take turns shooting crap at each other. Simple, proven, and dangerously addicting. Choosing
		the right ammo, equipping specific power-ups, and skillfully land each shot are all strategic parts
		of the game and where the magic happens! A healthy mix of world terrains, doodads, and weather effects
		as well as trick-shot bonuses ensures that there will be no shortage of dynamic playstyles!
